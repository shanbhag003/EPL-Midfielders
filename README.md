# Clustering EPL Midfielders in different groups accoding to their style of play

Midfielders are extremely important players on the field. In addition, there are many distinct types of midfielders, each of whom has a specific job to play for their side. However, we frequently hear people comparing two players with vastly different playing styles, which is incorrect. So I decided to do a project with the objective to divide these players into three or four groups using K-Means Clustering depending on 16 different parameters which are publicly available on fbref.com.

Tools used:

  Python
  Principal Component Analysis
  MinMax Scaling
  K-Means Clustering
